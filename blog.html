                <h3>What is DOM? What is the purpose of DOM</h3>
                <p>DOM also known as Document Object Model that can alter the document's structure, style, and content. it serves as a representation of the web page. Each node in the DOM's representation of the pageâ€”which is a tree structure containing nodes and objects which represents a different component of the document, such as an element, an attribute, or a text node. 

                    Using computer languages like JavaScript, developers can access and alter the information and structure of a web page using the DOM. This enables web designers to alter a web page's content and design by user actions. </p>

                <h3>How to select elements from DOM?</h3>
                <p>We can select DOM elements with the help of 5 functions. They are :
                    <ol>
                        <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
                        <li>getElementById()</li>
                        <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                        <li>querySelector()</li>
                        <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                    </ol></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is event bubble?</h3>
                <p>Event bubble relates to the order in which event handlers are called when one element is nested inside a second element, and both elements have registered a listener for the same event.
                    For example, when an event like mouse click occurs, it will be handled by the element itself first, then by its parent element, and so on until the event reaches the document's root element. Because the event "bubbles up" from the initial element to its parents.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is callback function & what is the use of it?</h3>
                <p>A callback function is a function that receives an event or condition as an input from another function. 
                    The callback function is used to create response to an event. These events may be keyboard type or mouse clicks. </p>
